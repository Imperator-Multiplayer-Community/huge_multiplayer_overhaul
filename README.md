[b]Huge Multiplayer Overhaul[/b] or ‘HMO’ is a mod that, well, does exactly what it says, overhauls Imperator: Rome solely for multiplayer. What does this entail? Making focused changes that retain the overall feel of I:R vanilla, while encouraging a fun, engaging and balanced game for multiplayer.

[b][i]This is the current and maintained version of HMO.[/i][/b]

This mod is intended for Multiplayer use only, you can use it in Singleplayer but the AI is never taken into consideration for our changes and sometimes we may even ‘gut it’ in order to add mechanics to the mod for players. It is currently only localized to English due to the small team and majority being English speakers only.

HMO has been given permission to integrate the following mods:
-Field of Mars (Built off of)
-Commander Kings
-Great Wonders Refined
-Bloodlines 2.0
-Imperator Navigable Rivers
-Legion Distinctions Overhaul
-Map Modes Enhanced and Clear Skies
-Metropolis Sprawl
-Clear and Solid Borders
-Invictus (Map)

Features Highlights:

[b]Broken World Map[/b] - Our custom map has been forged in the fires of many multiplayer campaigns. We break the map apart so that every nation has a somewhat balanced start.

[b]Mechanic Balance[/b] - The entire game has been rebalanced with multiplayer in mind from buildings to heritages to technology and units. This is also an ongoing progress as we aim to make all areas of the map, all government forms and all cultures viable AND competitive for multiplayer.

[b]Complete Military Traditions Overhaul[/b] - We have gutted the vanilla traditions system and built it from the ground up for multiplayer balance. While some cultural traditions remain, there are now brand new generic trees that every culture has access to, enabling maximum player flexibility. Values have also been normalized to maximize unit diversity and unit-versus-unit matchups.

[b]Terrain Combat modifiers[/b] - All units now have modifiers for combat ability on all terrain types to create more asymmetrical warfare. Archers can crush Heavy Infantry in rough terrain like mountains, forests and marshes whereas Heavy Infantry and Cavalry will dominate in the flat terrain like farmlands and plains. We have done this to break up the stagnant multiplayer meta of Heavy Infantry spam while also adding a fun layer of historical relevance to where units excelled.
Tribal Legions - We’ve successfully unlocked legions for tribal governments so that they can compete with other government types.

[b]Ship Abilities[/b] - We’ve added a number of new abilities that make naval warfare more engaging.

[b]Diplomatic Abilities[/b] - We’ve added a number of new diplomatic options to the character interaction menu for rulers. You can influence the world by sending manpower to an ally, offering vassalage to a player, or embargoing trade!

[b]New Event Chains[/b]- Characters can be improved through tasking office holders or going hunting. Espionage can be conducted when you hire a spymaster.

[b]New Formable Nations[/b] - There have been countless formable nations added into the game to spice up gameplay with such formables as Italia for non Roman Italian nations, Anatolia for Antolian nations etc. There have been too many to list added across the map varying in all shapes and sizes alongside ‘easter egg’ nations of historical or fantasy nations. (Visigothic Kingdom anyone? Indo-Germanic Empire?)

[b]Monarchy to Republic[/b] - We have added a mission tree to allow all Monarchies to attempt to become a republic, it wasn’t fair that it was only one way right? This should allow more fluidity in the game so players can really pick and choose what government type they want to be and are not restricted to a monarchy from game start.

[b]Culturally Unique Innovations[/b] - Dozens of new innovations have been added in for specific cultures, tags and even government forms to better enhance cultural diversity and history. Arabian nations now have access to innovations that showcase the Monsoon Trade with India, boosting their economies and naval range, Egypt has many new innovations surrounding the Pyramids, Nile food production while the Punics have access to innovations to showcase the serial production of their ships and huge trading empire.

[b]Cultural Decisions[/b] - Many new cultural decisions have been added to encourage players to not mass assimilate everyone. Now to get new traditions you must enact a decision on the culture and keep them integrated to continue to learn from their tradition tree, this also works for culturally unique innovations.

[b]Caste System[/b] - The religions of the Indian Subcontinent have been slightly reworked to better reflect the caste system and slow down the Indian blob that unbalances games. Hindu nations will find themselves struggling to promote their many new pops and begin to buckle under over expansion. To combat this the players will have to institute reforms in the forms of laws to negate some of the drawbacks.

[b]Overhaul of Regions[/] - To help balance out multiplayer ALL regions have been adjusted and several broken up with many new regions added to better balance the game. With this new system all regions are now competitive in pop sizes for legion creation, there are still a few standouts for players to fight over though.
