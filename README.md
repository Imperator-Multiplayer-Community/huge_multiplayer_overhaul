Huge Multiplayer Overhaul

The latest and greatest from the Imperator: Rome multiplayer community.
-- Version 3 --

* Oratory tech tree rework (overhauled the whole left tree, some changes on the right as well)
* New invention added to Civic tech tree that reduces metropolis founding cost

* Metropolises now grant additional trade routes and 10% pop output
* Metropolises can now be built adjacent to other Metropolises (previously on in province capitals). Credit to chinerpeton for his Mod: Metropolis Sprawl.
 -- Metropolises were hardly seen worthwhile to be built by players. Hopefully these buffs will encourage more metropolises.

* Tyranny over 50 will now result in dimished returns for AE reduction and slave output
* When keeping Tyranny below 10 for at least a year, country will get a 15% max research efficiency modifier
 -- Tyranny was too good not to just max out almost all the time. Now the higher levels aren't as powerful and there's some incentive for players to not max out their tyranny

* Country ranks have aggressive expansion impact modifiers
 -- Lower ranks have reduced impact while higher ranks have increasingly higher impact
* Raising levies adds 1 AE per levies rasied
* Creating a legion addes +0.02 aggressive expansion for each legion created
* Stabbing pigs effect lasts 10 years
 -- This is intended to be an option for combatting high AE since tyranny won't reduce it as much  

* Big balance overhaul. Almost all bonus values have been reduced by about 50%. Legions were simply too strong now that it became much easier to hit max bonuses with floors!
* One level of floors for most distinctions have been removed. Most floors are at level 5 and level 10 now for units and level 3 for terrain.
* Drilling will now give a low chance for your legions to gain some distinctions providing they meet the requirements criteria.
* Army size to qualify for great battles has been raised to 30k (unit requirements are still just 20 cohorts though).
* Added a new feature that records total victories and defeats for your legion in its history.

* Added aqueduct maintenance. The first 4 aqueducts are free and then each addition aqueduct will reduce the province's taxes. Public works maintenance isn't free!

* Capture stance now gives -10% naval movement speed and Ramming gives +10% movement speed
 -- Trying to buff ramming over capture to offer other options for players
* Added scaling naval maintenance. Every 100 ships will add 10% more naval maintenance due to increased maintenance scale (up to 50%).
* Ports now have a small reduction in naval maintenance. Build lots of ports to offset the costs of maintaining a large fleet.
 -- Players were able to build huge fleets for little cost or draw back. Now there might be something to be said for quality over quantity. Or at least a naval power will need the ports to maintain its fleet...

* Civil wars have been made more painful. Disloyal provinces will quickly become disloyal upon the outbreak of civil war when legions are involved. Opposing armies are more powerful as well. Maybe triggering a civil war isn't a good thing anymore...

* Hunting has been balanced somewhat. Much less martial gain and in general martial gain from is now capped at +5 across all character improvement events.

* Added cooldowns to recruit talent and present debutante. These were being exploited to adopt new characters into one family and triggering a reduction in wages paid. Additionally all the extra chracters were causing lag.

* Added new feature to auto slave movement to disable the movement of slaves from another territory that was importing them. This should allow you to set up one-way highways for slave movement.
 -- In theory icons should finally show up?!

* Fort maintenance increased and excess fort maintence increased
* Base garrison size doubled
* Base garrison growth reduced
* Earthworks now grants 2 fort levels
* Fort and Earthworks costs and build times increased
 -- Forts were still being spammed a lot for not much consequence. In exchange for making them stronger they are now a bit more expensive as well. Earthworks was given a slight buff to make them more attractive and they should be a good options now that forts are more costly to maintain.

* General Military balancing across all traditions (more will come in the future)
 -- We attempted to normalize some values across all traditions through various strategies. For example a Gaullic tradition gave +20% forest combat modifier, which was very strong; now it just gives it to the archer unit.
* Slightly raised Military XP for disbanding levies
* Removed martial from bloodlines
* Military XP no longer earned from leaders marital now through Military laws. 
 -- In general, the overall amount of military XP generated has been nerfed

* 5 new nations in the steppe 1 in Pannonia 
* Byzantine Empire, Greater Scythia and Crimmera formables
* New map tiles in Ethiopia 
* All of Indian regions changed (should look more like vanilla) 
* Britain, Western Arabia and Cyrenaica regions changed 

* Civilisation Value Pop growth amount and assimilation speed reduced. 
 -- Excessive pop growth was causing lag. In version 2 pops would assimilate before they converted, which was hurting tech efficiency among other issues.)

* Tribes
 -- Less mercenary cost for tribes from 50% to 25%
 -- Removed global tech output nerf
 -- Increased base mil XP from being a tribe, you will now generate more XP than civil nations. 
 -- Lowered % increase nerf to found cities as a tribe
 -- Reduced Pi cost of reforming and made easier 

* Removed the town evolution feature
 -- There were some cool ideas here, but ultimately the building evolution was confusing and really didn't help nations that needed it the most (tribal) since the requirements were too high for the poor terrain.

-- Version 2
* From the last grand campaign MOD, balanced Levy XP has been added. Now when you disband you levies you gain XP like in vanilla. Note: there's a new button for disbanding a single levy available next to other unit actions (on the right, not the left) when you focus on that levy unit.
* Character interaction have been fixed, fleshed out and expanded upon.
* Map changes in the Persia areas. Other map fixes around Tibet. Fixed a river crossing.
* War score changes - can now earned up to 50 war score from war goal. Rejecting a fair peace deal will now cause 15 stability loss. Truces are now 10 years.
* Gifting manpower has new costs and requirements
* Added vassalage character interaction to offer players a unique vassal type (must be under 150 cities)
* updated some wonder effects
* Other various bug fixes
* Adds russian localization for many of the mod features
