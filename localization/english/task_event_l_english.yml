 task.7.t:0 "Bandit Attack"
 task.7.desc:0 "While attempting to restore security to a major bridge, [target.GetName] was attacked and overwhelmed by brigands, whose number and ferocity gave [target.GetHerHim] flight, leaving [target.GetHerHis] men behind to die." 
 task.7.a:0 "There is no room for cowards in your service"
 task.8.t:0 "Ploughing the Sea"
 task.8.desc:0 "You receive interesting reports about [target.GetName]'s mission to secure the sea. Not only has [target.GetSheHe] captured several pirate leaders, but [target.GetSheHe] claims to have glimpsed mermaids and survived a terrible storm at sea. It sounds almost impressive."
 task.8.a:0 "The whole crew will be rewarded"
 task.9.t:0 "Disaster at Sea"
 task.9.desc:0 "[target.GetName]'s mission to secure the sea has been a disaster. After losing a skirmish with some pirates, what was left of the fleet was struck by a thunderstorm and most of the ships sank.

 task.9.a:0 "This was clearly a mistake"
 task.10.t:0 "Left, Right! Left, Right!"
 task.10.desc:0 "[target.GetName] has settled into [target.GetHerHis] new role perfectly and has in fact won the last few drill competitions in the capital, making [target.GetHerHim] the talk of the town. [target.GetHerHis] soldiers feel all the more confident, as there is no manoeuvre they cannot execute."
 task.10.a:0 "A disciplined army is a triumphant army"
 task.11.t:0 "Two Left Feet"
 task.11.desc:0 "[target.GetName]'s new task as a drill instructor has not gone well. [target.GetHerHis] domineering attitude has alienated the men. Demoralised, they make little effort to coordinate and march like an ungovernable horde. To make matters worse, [target.GetName] seems incapable of walking in a straight line and actually fell in a recent bout of clumsiness and broke [target.GetHerHis] ankle."
 task.11.a:0 "Next time, just stick to a desk job"
 task.12.t:0 "Lessons of History"
 task.12.desc:0 "Having read all [target.GetSheHe] could on the greatest battles in history, [target.GetName] is now as knowledgeable about all the different strategies and tactics as anyone in the realm.

 task.12.a:0 "Serving the state is the best reward"
 task.13.t:0 "Bookworm"
 task.13.desc:0 "Having read all [target.GetSheHe] could on the greatest battles in history, [target.GetName] is now a permanent fixture of the library, too weak to wield a sword and unable to rise from [target.GetHerHis] reading chair. It seems like a slap in the face that [target.GetSheHe] has started to complain of ill health."
 task.13.a:0 "Some time at a work camp would make them feel better"
 task.14.t:0 "Lend Me Your Ears"
 task.14.desc:0 "Word reaches you that [target.GetName] has been spending time in the forum and at the market, engaging in rhetorical battle with anyone who accepts the challenge.

 task.14.a:0 "Some people can convince you of anything"
 task.15.t:0 "Clumsy Propaganda"
 task.15.desc:0 "Our recent efforts to shape public opinion have not gone well. [target.GetName] is a terrible public speaker. Stiff and unrehearsed, [target.GetSheHe] delivers [target.GetHerHis] speeches in a monotonous drone and they are so bad that they have an undesired effect. Last week, [target.GetSheHe] was even attacked by hecklers and wounded in the face!"
 task.15.a:0 "Put an end to this at once"
 task.16.t:0 "Sub Rosa Talks"
 task.16.desc:0 "By gathering sordid secrets about noble families in the capital and using them against them like weapons, [target.GetName] has weakened budding threats to your power and fortified the state."
 task.16.a:0 "Make sure people tell the stories that we want them to hear"     
 task.17.t:0 "Blowback"
 task.17.desc:0 "[target.GetName] has spread many rumours targeting the greatest threats to your power, and most of them have stuck. However, an untrue story about a donkey and someone's wife was traced back to [target.GetName] and the victim got revenge by attacking [target.GetHerHim] in broad daylight and beating [target.GetHerHim] unconscious."
 task.17.a:0 "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can crush my heart :-("
 task.18.t:0 "A Masterpiece of Literature"
 task.18.desc:0 "[target.GetName]'s series of writings on the history of our realm are astonishing feats of scholarship that are as gripping as they are informed. Surely they will cause our reputation to only grow, and deservedly so!"
 task.18.a:0 "Copies must be sent to every noble family for study"
 task.19.t:0 "Malevolent Inspiration"
 task.19.desc:0 "Something is not right in [target.GetName]'s soul. [target.GetHerHis] time spent composing [target.GetHerHis] annals seem to have opened the door of [target.GetHerHis] mind to every mischievous spirit and demon, and the mad scribbling that [target.GetSheHe] has produced makes us fear for [target.GetHerHis] sanity."
 task.19.a:0 "Some time at a work camp would make them feel better"
 task.20.t:0 "Top of the Social Pyramid"
 task.20.desc:0 "[target.GetName]'s efforts to socialise with our noble class have been successful and [target.GetSheHe] has even reportedly been involved in the occasional sex scandal. By gaining their confidence, [target.GetSheHe] has gathered sensitive information that could prove their undoing... if they step out of line, that is."
 task.20.a:0 "If they are compliant, they have nothing to fear"
 task.21.t:0 "Bottom of the Food Chain"
 task.21.desc:0 "Rather than influence our nation's aristocrats, as we had hoped, [target.GetName] has gone about [target.GetHerHis] mission with great gusto, though [target.GetSheHe] has clearly taken more interest in stuffing [target.GetHerHis] face and drinking all the wine in the province than in gathering useful intelligence."
 task.21.a:0 "A weekend working in the mines would bring them to their senses"
 task.22.t:0 "Everything in Order"
 task.22.desc:0 "[target.GetName] has recently finished a thorough review of the state's accounts, uncovering much waste and unnecessary expenditure, as well as some areas that still escape our scrutiny. By acting on [target.GetHerHis] recommendations, we will save money and strengthen our grip on the administration."
 task.22.a:0 "We are fortunate to have such a capable servant"
 task.23.t:0 "Cooking the Books"
 task.23.desc:0 "Having been tasked with reviewing the state's accounts, [target.GetName] seems to have made an even worse mess of things, as the balance sheets are now longer and more complicated than ever. Although we cannot prove that [target.GetName] has been benefitting directly from this disorder or is somehow involved in malversation, we still have our suspicions..."
 task.23.a:0 "Keep a close eye on that one"
 task.24.t:0 "Draining the Swamp"
 task.24.desc:0 "[target.GetName] has pursued [target.GetHerHis] mission with vigour, divesting corrupt officials of their offices and stripping them of their privileges. Though [target.GetSheHe] is obviously encountering resistance, [target.GetHerHis] political instincts have allowed [target.GetHerHim] to keep the upper hand."
 task.24.a:0 "Flush them all out!"
 task.25.t:0 "The Deep State Strikes Back"
 task.25.desc:0 "By challenging the bureaucrats, [target.GetName] made more enemies than [target.GetSheHe] could ever hope to fight alone. A recent attack at a bathhouse left [target.GetHerHim] wounded and [target.GetSheHe] has taken a very different tone ever since, arguing in public that the current administration is the cleanest and most efficient in our nation's history."
 task.25.a:0 "Our agent seems to be compromised"
 task.26.t:0 "Expanding the Administration"
 task.26.desc:0 "Word has reached you that [target.GetName] is making great progress in expanding government oversight and regulation to unprecedented areas that had previously avoided scrutiny. Of course this occasionally interferes with some people's personal privileges, but the needs of the state demand it. We are lucky to have such a capable servant."
 task.26.a:0 "Tabulate everything in existence"
 task.27.t:0 "Bureaucratic Lethargy"
 task.27.desc:0 "Complacent and drowsy, [target.GetName] has made little effort to improve administrative efficiency or oversight and is reportedly using [target.GetHerHis] new powers arbitrarily, for personal gain. It is even rumoured that an angry witch cast a spell on [target.GetHerHim], causing [target.GetHerHim] to develop a skin disease, though physicians think that [target.GetSheHe] will recover."
 task.27.a:0 "Just another parasite..." 
 task.28.t:0 "A Comprehensive Account"
 task.28.desc:0 "[target.GetName]'s review of the state inventories has exceeded expectations, revealing the existence of funds and weapons that had been presumed lost and devising and new and more efficient way to keep track of our stored property. Perhaps a reward is in order?"
 task.28.a:0 "Our satisfaction should be reward enough"
 task.29.t:0 "A Disappearing Act"
 task.29.desc:0 "[target.GetName]'s mission to review the state inventories is not going well. No report or statement has been issued and even the inspector went missing for a week. [target.GetSheHe] was found in a dreadful state, near death, having been locked inside one of the state warehouses for days. If [target.GetSheHe] manages to recover, [target.GetSheHe] will probably be marked for life, and not in a good way."
 task.29.a:0 "Imagine getting locked in a warehouse..."
 task.30.t:0 "An Oracle Speaks"
 task.30.desc:0 "Having been told about two possible courses of action that we could take, your servant [target.GetName] consulted an oracle and asked which path was more favourable. The oracle responded, its advice was followed and we have been blessed with divine favour. This year's offering will have to be doubled."
 task.30.a:0 "I think we should triple the offering"
 task.31.t:0 "An Oracle Contradicted"
 task.31.desc:0 "After concluding that two possible options have equal chances for success, we had [target.GetName] consult an oracle on the best choice. Though the oracle's response was quite straightforward, [target.GetName] pressed it to change, angering the priests and exposing us to the danger of divine retribution. Days later, [target.GetName] cursed the oracle's name and immediately suffered a seizure."
 task.31.a:0 "Apologise to the priests and make an offering at once"
 task.32.t:0 "Auspicious Signs"
 task.32.desc:0 "Apparently, your servant [target.GetName] was recently involved in a sacrificial ritual that bodes very well for the future. Upon examining the goat's entrails, as usual, [target.GetName] found some nodes on the liver arranged in such a way that we should enjoy seven years of good harvest."
 task.32.a:0 "May the gods be praised!"
 task.33.t:0 "A Diseased Sacrifice"
 task.33.desc:0 "Your servant [target.GetName] was recently involved in a sacrificial ritual that ended ominously. Upon examining the goat's entrails, as usual, [target.GetName] was overcome by a sickening stench. That night, [target.GetSheHe] fell ill and has been bedridden ever since. This cannot possibly be a good sign. Though physicians say that [target.GetSheHe] will recover, we think it best to replace [target.GetHerHim] in matters relating to sacrificial divination for now. Even if it arouses [target.GetHerHis] jealousy, it is not worth angering the gods."
 task.33.a:0 "It is never worth angering the gods"
 task.34.t:0 "Beautiful Dreams"
 task.34.desc:0 "[target.GetName] has spent the last few months exploring the world of dreams, hopeful to detect a sign of what the future holds. Though we think it may be too early to draw a conclusion, [target.GetSheHe] is notably optimistic, claiming that the lovely visions that have been coming to [target.GetHerHim] at night give every cause for celebration. Indeed, [target.GetHerHis] very demeanour seems to have changed for the better."
 task.34.a:0 "Truly it is beautiful to dream"
 task.35.t:0 "Night Terrors"
 task.35.desc:0 "[target.GetName] has spent the last few months exploring the world of dreams, hopeful to detect a sign of what the future holds. While [target.GetSheHe] reported restful sleep and intriguing visions at first, things have lately taken a dark turn, with a series of nightmares so lucid and vivid that they have clearly shaken [target.GetHerHim]. Now [target.GetSheHe] claims to not even believe in the gods anymore, when [target.GetSheHe] isn't simply babbling away like an idiot..."
 task.35.a:0 "I hope it is not a sign of bad things to come"
 task.36.t:0 "An Uncommon Grace"
 task.36.desc:0 "[target.GetName] has spent the last few months studying the flight of birds over the capital for a sign of what the future holds. The exquisite and highly expressive movement of birds offer many clues to what the Fates have planned for us, and lately [target.GetName] brings only good news, assuring us that the gods smile on us these days."
 task.36.a:0 "May the gods be praised!"
 task.37.t:0 "Three Crows"
 task.37.desc:0 "Having travelled to a location famous for its use in bird divination, [target.GetName] observed the flocks for hours, waiting for an interpretable sign, when three large crows landed before [target.GetHerHim]. Hours passed and the crows remained. Unnerved, the local priests tried to chase the crows away with bells and horns, but the crows stared ahead, defiantly. After two days of this, [target.GetName]'s mind had devolved to a primitive state, either because the crows were spirits who had entered [target.GetHerHis] soul or because of some mental weakness. Since then, [target.GetName] is hardly responsive, as if part of [target.GetHerHis] mind has been taken away." 
 task.37.a:0 "Better them than me!"
 
 task.38.t:0 "Long Arm of the Law"
 task.38.desc:0 "[target.GetName] has shown original thinking while keeping the roads safe for travellers again."
