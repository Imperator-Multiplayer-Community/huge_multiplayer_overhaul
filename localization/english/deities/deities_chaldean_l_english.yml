 omen_ashshur:1 "Ashshur"
 omen_ashshur_desc:3 "Ashshur, the mighty god, the one whom by his furious eyes make foreign people and foes shake in fear and despair, again and again saved the Country. Strong and exhilarated, his furor can be appeased only by the blood of battle, and by the honor and glory of the kings revering him in his temples.\n\nIn the old days, Ashshur permitted his kings and his princes to expand his power; and when he had settled upon their fate to be reversed, always did he restore them to their former glory. Assuredly, if he reaches his hand over us, we are certain to expand once again, to bring back from foreign lands their wealth, their men, women and children to labor for re-establishing our former glory and our former power!"

 omen_ninurta:1 "Ninurta"
 omen_ninurta_desc:3 "Ninurta is strong, mighty and exalted in the fight. He is the one that defeat the demons with his mallet Sharur, like he did to Anzu and his army of stones. Ninurta alone could fight him, keeping his resolve in the battle.\n\nIf Ninurta looks with favor at our armies, assuredly we will prevail. If the great god favors us, we are certain our troops will push back those that drove us once, and we will submit to the tribute any of those people that surround us and that wished to create chaos in the Country. Then, his sanctuaries at Nippur in Babylonia and at Kalhu in Assyria will be restored to their former glory, and the people once again will live in peace when our victory is achieved."

 omen_ishtar_desc:3 "Ishtar is the warlike goddess, the one that drive men crazy with her seven magical fineries. She may force them into the deepest despair, as well as oblige them to exert themselves for reaching the greatest glory. So did she with her lover Tammuz, whom she abandoned into Hell, as well as with Gilgamesh, who had to fight against her savage bull to bring peace back in Uruk.\n\nIshtar is double-faced, being both the patron of physical love, this one driving men and women to have numerous sons; but she he also the war goddess, the one pushing men to flock into the armies for the battle. With her favor, assuredly our armies will be filled with young and strong men, able to push away the borders of the Country."
 deity_ea:0 "$omen_ea$"
 omen_ea:1 "Ea"
 omen_ea_desc:4 "Ea is the patron god of learned and wise men, of craftsmen and creators. His knowledge and his understanding often saved the Country from disaster. Is he not the one that put an end to this strike by minor gods, by creating mankind so that they could release them with their labor? Is he not the one who saved those same men from the Flood, by ordering Uta-Napishti to build a great wooden ark?\n\nWith Ea's favor, scholars, scribes and lettered will obtain wisdom and knowledge, insight and understanding. With their inventions, they will make the Country the heart of the world again, and of our cities the seat of a strong rule, dispenser of both peace and profusion."

Our prosperity will be assured then, and the treasures of gods and king alike will be filled thanks to the god's favor and his knowledge and insight."
 deity_enlil:0 "$omen_enlil$"
 omen_enlil:1 "Enlil"
 omen_enlil_desc:3 "Enlil created everything here below. He is the father of the gods, the one who made mankind and the Country. His strong words do and undo empires, and he is the one who decide the fate of everyone.\n\nIf Enlil looks down at us with favor, assuredly he will give us all those lands surrounding the Country. He will allow for the return of mighty kings, and will give them the rulership over far and away territories. Be it by our mighty troops or by those scourges that in the olden days carried off mortals, very soon the Country will expand to the rims of the world, to the places that his breath the wind reaches: to the banks of the bitter Apsu surrounding Earth."
 deity_shamash:0 "$omen_shamash$"
 omen_shamash:1 "Shamash"
 omen_shamash_desc:3 "The radiant god, the Sun brings warmth and joy to the Country. Up from the skies, he sees everything, knows everything in the hearts of men.

Thanks to him, the riches of the whole world will converge to bedeck the sanctuaries and the palaces, and the god will make sure the return of our prosperity like in the days of those mighty kings of old."

What would they be without his favor, him who oversees the growth of crops and the fertility of herds and women?\n\nWith Sin looking with favor over the Country, then the harvest will be plentiful, the cattle will multiply and the population will grow, until overflowing–like the great rivers flooding the plain before assaulting up the mountains."
