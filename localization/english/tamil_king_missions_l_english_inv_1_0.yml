me_tamil_king_12_title:0 "Bad News from the Trade Fleet"
me_tamil_king_12_desc:0 "A calamity! Our prized trade fleet, while sailing by a few offshore islands, was caught in an ocean storm and smashed against the rocks, utterly annihilating every ship. Only a few crewmen were able to make it back to shore, using broken bits of the ship as makeshift rafts, ultimately making the arduous journey back home to report of their misfortune. You do not want to know, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], how much money we have lost..."

me_tamil_king_13_title:0 "Trade Fleet Arrives Home"
me_tamil_king_13_desc_1:0 "Our vaunted trade fleet has arrived back to home port, laden with riches and exotic items from the distant eastern land of Serica. In addition to the typical eastern goods such as hardwoods, jade, bronze artworks, gold and precious gems, our trade fleet has also brought a number of other exotic beasts and items never before seen by our people. These include an enormous black and white bear creature which the Chinese call 'Mo', a strange flammable and explosive powder, the knowledge of how to cultivate mulberry trees and raising silkworms from these trees, and a dangerous green creature with talons said to be an infant version of the fabled Chinese dragon. Most astonishing is the beautifully crafted jade disc said to belong to a Chinese king of the distant past, called Heshibi."
me_tamil_king_13_desc_2:0 "At long last our trade fleet has returned with stories and riches from the far western metropolis the natives call Roma. Here our merchants sold their goods to these Romans in exchange for a number of items, such as various fine pottery vessels, amber, gold, olives, fine wines, and all manner of beautiful textiles. Large artisan vessels carrying a vibrant purple dye were also acquired, and a fine garment was created and washed with this dye, and inlaid with gold, said to be worn only by kings; this fabulous garb was a personal gift of the Roman leaders for our majesty. Among the most stunning items include a marble statue carved into the likeness of our great ruler, which was crafted by Roman artisans with physical descriptions of our sovereign given by the crewmen."
me_tamil_king_13_desc_3:0 "News has reached the capital that our trade fleet has finally returned from the mystical lands of Arabia. In exchange for the riches of India, the various cities of the Arabian coast sold a number of aromatics and valuable goods, such as frankincense, myrrh, coffee, fine pearls, precious gems, gold as well as goods from more distant lands, such as hard ebony wood, ivory, and unknown tropical fruits from the jungles of the interior of Africa. A curious stimulant plant, known as qat by the Arabians, was also procured, which is administered by chewing the plant leaves. Most curious of all were the exotic beasts of Africa obtained by the Arabs and traded to us; a giant, long-necked chimera with patterns all over it, two large, human-like hairy beasts and a huge, two-horned grey beasts with skin made of armor."
me_tamil_king_13_desc_4:0 "The grand trade fleet has finally arrived home from the fabled lands of the great Pharaohs. Our fleet was greeted well by the locals at a great metropolis named after the world conqueror Alexander. In exchange for all that mighty India had to offer, the Egyptians gave us astonishing gold artworks, glass ornaments, papyrus, fine purple gems, and a number of beautifully crafted artworks that once belonged to Pharaohs of the distant past. Among these items were a masterfully carved yellow scarab, produced from a rare yellow glass found in the whirling sands beyond the Nile. The most precious item of all was a strangely shaped and patterned dagger made from a black and silver rock, said to have fallen from heaven as a gift to the Pharaoh."
