 illyrian_piracy_path_1:0 "Illyrian Pirates"
 illyrian_piracy_path_1_desc:0 "With Italia divided amongst rival states and much of Greece focused on conflicts to the east, the Adriatic is easy pickings for pirates sailing out of the many inlets of the Illyrian coast."

 illyrian_piracy_path_2_desc:0 "When facing militarily superior foes, speed is crucial to preserving our forces and taking advantage of terrain."
 illyrian_path_1:0 "The Liburnian"
 illyrian_path_1_desc:0 "The ship that would eventually form the basis of the Roman navy was originally invented by the Illyrian tribe of the same name. Equipped with only one row of oars, one mast and one sail, it could not directly match the larger ships built by the Greeks, but the Illyrians' superior speed and maneuverability let them dominate the Adriatic nonetheless."
 illyrian_piracy_path_5:0 "Bold Sailors"

 illyrian_piracy_path_6:0 "Local Shipbuilding"

 illyrian_path_2:0 "Ship Binding"

 illyrian_path_3:0 "Drakoforos"
 illyrian_path_3_desc:0 "The drakoforos was a ship with a dragon's head mounted on the prow. By building larger and harder-hitting craft, we will be better able to defend our coasts from those who wish us harm."

 illyrian_path_5:0 "The Young Must Serve"

 # New Daco-Thracian Military Traditions
 thracian_path_1:0 "Falx and Sica"
 thracian_path_1_desc:0 "The falx and sica were curved bladed weapons. The edge of the blade was on the inward side of the curve, allowing warriors to strike at the arms and legs around their opponents' shields.  So effective were these weapons, that in later years the Dacian Wars resulted in changes to the standard armour of the Roman soldier."
 thracian_path_2:0 "Thracian Horsemanship"
 thracian_path_2_desc:0 "The cavalry of the Thracians was of particular renown, with Philipp II of Macedon adapting the wedge formation from them. In particular, the Getae in the north were said to be indistinguishable from the feared Scythians."
 thracian_path_3:0 "Tribal Kingdoms"
 thracian_path_3_desc:0 "The area north of Greece saw the emergence of many tribal kingdoms. When united under a strong king, they were a force to be reckoned with, yet such centralisation efforts often faced opposition from various local powerholders jealously guarding their ancient privileges."

 thracian_path_4_desc:0 "The ability to use all our troops in the mountainous regions near our homes is vital to our survival."
 thracian_path_5:0 "Melting Pot"

 thracian_path_6:0 "Colonies"
 thracian_path_6_desc:0 "As our population grows, let us learn from the Greeks to the south and found colonies across the landscape, rewarding veterans with landed property that they will eagerly fight to defend."
 thracian_path_7:0 "Peltasts"
 thracian_path_7_desc:0 "The tribes north of Macedon often shunned armor, which was restricted to nobles and kings. The Thracians in particular preferred to fight as peltasts, carrying javelins alongside a sword and a wicker shield called a pelte. Their great manoeuvrability allowed them to outrun the heavier Greek infantry, while also performing well in melee, unlike dedicated skirmishers."
 thracian_path_8:0 "Take up Arms"
 thracian_path_8_desc:0 "Every man has a place in our armies; not least the hunters, who stalk their prey on battlefield and forest alike."
 thracian_path_9:0 "Dava"
 thracian_path_9_desc:0 "These stone fortresses, built into the mountains, utilised concentric rings of defense allowing defenders to withdraw inward and continue fighting if the outer defences were breached."
 thracian_path_10:0 "The Plains Fight with Us"
 thracian_path_10_desc:0 "The rolling plains of Dacia prove ideal terrain for the use of cavalry and fast-moving infantry."
 thracian_path_11:0 "Trained Cavalry"
 thracian_path_11_desc:0 "Domestic horses, while sufficient for defence in emergencies, are inclined to panic on the battlefield. Thus, by expanding our stock of horses bred and trained for war, our bold warriors will excel at their true purpose."
 thracian_path_12:0 "Tarabostes"
 thracian_path_12_desc:0 "Nobles played a very important role in the highly militarised Dacian society. Only Dacian aristocrats had the right to cover their heads and wore felt Phrygian caps. In battle, they might wear a bronze Phrygian helmet, iron scale armour and an oval wooden shield."
 thracian_path_13:0 "Offence Is the Best Defence"
 thracian_path_13_desc:0 "Many of our warriors do not even fight with shields, preferring instead to focus all their energy on relentlessly attacking the enemy."

 nubian_path_2_desc:0 "Nubian archers used their thumb rather than their index finger to pull back their tight bowstrings. Thumb rings made of granite or silver, depending on the status of the wearer, with the thicker end resting on the base of the thumb, prevented the string from chaffing the skin so it could be drawn back further. Thumb rings were also used as arrow rests. Nubian archers also wore bracelets to protect their hands from injury. They wore their quivers on the front, not the back."
 nubian_path_3:0 "Nubian Cavalry"
 nubian_path_3_desc:0 "Horses were an important part of the Nubian military. The Assyrian Army strengthened its cavalry with Nubian horses and riders and Nubian horse experts served Assyrian kings from Tiglath-pileser III to Ashurbanipal."

 nubian_path_4_desc:0 "The large, labyrinth-like great enclosure complex of Musawwarat es-Sufra, in modern Sudan, contains many pictorial references to elephants, suggesting it could have been used as an elephant care facility or training camp.

 nubian_path_13_desc:0 "By building the largest and strongest ships, we can prowl the waves the equal of any titan or monster we may find there."
 nubian_path_14:0 "Kushitic Longbow Nubian Tradition"
 nubian_path_14_desc:0 "So from the battlements as though on the walls of a citadel, the archers kept up with a continual discharge of well aimed shafts, so dense that the Persians had the sensation of a cloud descending upon them, especially when the Kushites made their enemies' eyes the targets. So unerring was their aim that those who they pierced with their shafts rushed about wildly in the throngs with the arrows projecting from their eyes like double flutes."

 
 #Arabian Tree
 arabian_path_1:0 "Arabia Felix"
 arabian_path_1_desc:0 "Commonly misunderstood to mean 'happy', the name 'Felix' stressed the fertility of South Arabia. The name was given by Greeks and Romans because of the area’s pleasant climate and great wealth in agricultural products, incense and spices."
 arabian_path_2:0 "Sayf Anith"

They were prized by Bedouin and probably first domesticated along the northern edge of the Fertile Crescent. Arabians were bred to be war horses with speed, endurance, soundness and intelligence. Mares were preferred over stallions because they were quieter and would not betray their position."

 babylonian_path_3_desc:0 "Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of war, was worshipped as Ishtar by the Akkadians, Babylonians and Assyrians.

 babylonian_path_6:0 "Gate of Ishtar"
 babylonian_path_6_desc:0 "I am Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, the pious prince appointed by the will of Marduk, the highest priestly prince, beloved of Nabu, of prudent deliberation, who has learnt to embrace wisdom, who fathomed Marduk and Nabu's godly beings and pays reverence to their Majesty, the untiring governor, who always has at heart the care of the cult of Esagila and Ezida and is constantly concerned with the well being of Babylon and Borsippa, the wise, the humble, the caretaker of Esagila and Ezida, the first born son of Nabopolassar, the King of Babylon. I pulled down these gates and laid their foundations at the water table with asphalt and bricks and had them made of bricks with blue stone on which wonderful bulls and dragons were depicted. I covered their roofs by laying majestic cedars lengthwise over them. I fixed doors of cedar wood adorned with bronze at all the gate openings. I placed wild bulls and ferocious dragons in the gateways and thus adorned them with luxurious splendour so that mankind might gaze on them in wonder. I let the temple of Esiskursiskur, the highest festival house of Marduk, the lord of the gods, a place of joy and jubilation for the major and minor deities, be built firm like a mountain in the precinct of Babylon of asphalt and fired bricks."
 babylonian_path_7:0 "Navigating the Marshes"

Enlil assigned him as a terror to human beings and whoever goes down into his forest will be striken down!' But Gilgamesh replied to Enkidu, saying 'Now you are afraid of death... What has become of your bold strength? I will go in front of you and you can call out to me to go on closer, to not be afraid. Should I fall, I will have established my fame. They will say it was Gilgamesh who did battle with Humbaba the Terrible. You were born and raised in the wilderness, a lion leaped up on you, so you have experienced it all! I will undertake it and I will cut down the Cedar Forest. It is I who will establish fame for eternity! Come, my friend, let us go to the forge and have them cast the weapons in our presence!'"

Your destiny is unequalled. Your command is like Anu's. Henceforth, your order will not be annulled. It is in your power to exalt and abase. Your utterance is sure, your command cannot be rebelled against. None of the gods will transgress the line you draw. Shrines for all the gods needs provisioning so you may be established where their sanctuaries are. You are Marduk, our avenger. We have given you kingship over the sum of the whole universe.

 assyrian_path_2_desc:0 "Starting in the 10th century BC, the Assyrians gradually supplemented their army of conscripted farmers with a standing professional military, with specialised roles for infantry, cavalry and chariots."
 assyrian_path_3:0 "Assyrian Lancers"
 assyrian_path_3_desc:0 "The Assyrians first incorporated cavalry into their army in the 8th century BC. At first, horsemen rode in pairs, consisting of one knight and one squire, as they were essentially conceived as charioteers without a chariot. While the knight loosed his composite bow against the enemy, the squire would hold his horse's reins. Over time, Assyrian cavalry began to ride alone and became better armoured, with even the horses wearing cloth armour. Shock cavalrymen, armed with a lance, could be dressed in scale armour, though this considerably reduced their agility."
 assyrian_path_4:0 "Siege Engines"
 assyrian_path_4_desc:0 "During the siege of Lachish, King Sennacherib (704-681 BCE) deployed several battering rams at the weakest points of the walls at the same time. The poles of these rams had been extended, providing more reach and leverage. Archers were perched atop these rams as they moved forward to protect the soldiers moving them and to prevent the city's defenders from launching a fire attack."
 assyrian_path_5:0 "Champions of Ashur"
 assyrian_path_5_desc:0 "The chariots, coaches, palanquins, his concubines, the goods of his palace, they brought before me. As for those men and their vulgar mouths, who uttered vulgarity against Ashur, my god, and plotted evil against me, the prince who fears him, I slit their tongues and brought them low. As for the rest of the people, alive, by the colossi, between which they had cut down Sennacherib, the father of the father who begot me, at that time, I cut them down there, as an offering to his shade. I fed their dismembered bodies to the dogs, swine, wolves and eagles, to the birds of heaven and the fish of the deep."

 assyrian_path_7:0 "Road Stations"
 assyrian_path_7_desc:0 "Every governor of the Neo-Assyrian Empire was responsible for maintaining strategic road stations that helped to measure stretches and mark intersections of the King's Road (Hul Sharri). Reserved for government use, these road stations were important parts of the mule-driven relay communication system, which allowed letters to be sent much faster than before. The vast road network also permitted quick troop deployment and was instrumental in keeping the empire cohesive."
 assyrian_path_8:0 "Tooth and Nail"
 assyrian_path_8_desc:0 "Like the onset of a terrible hurricane I overwhelmed Elam in its entirety. I cut off the head of Teumann, their king, the haughty one, who plotted evil. Countless of his warriors I slew. Alive, with my hands, I seized his fighters. With their corpses I filled the plain about Susa as with baltu and ashagu. Their blood I let run down the Ulai; its water I dyed red like wool and the ravines and torrents of the mountain swallowed the rest of them. I carried off captives and possessions from them. I cut off their warriors' heads and built a tower before their city. I burnt their adolescent boys and girls."
 assyrian_path_9:0 "Sappers"
 assyrian_path_9_desc:0 "Sappers were heavily armoured with long mail coverings and wore a conical helmet with mail protecting the face and neck. They were sent to the walls during sieges, where they would help to dislodge battering rams when they got stuck to the wall with crowbars and picks. Sappers also dug tunnels under the city walls, bracing them with wooden supports while digging a deep and wide cavity. Then they would set fire to the wooden supports, causing the walls' foundation to weaken and collapse."
 assyrian_path_10:0 "Shield Bearers"
 assyrian_path_10_desc:0 "Assyrian archers were often accompanied by a shield bearer, who would cover them with a large shield of made densely matted reed covered with metal or hide while they prepared the next arrow."
 assyrian_path_11:0 "Sariam"
 assyrian_path_11_desc:0 "The Assyrian use of scale armour allowed archers to defend ground and engage in frontal attacks, making them more versatile."
 assyrian_path_12:0 "The Art of the Siege"
 assyrian_path_12_desc:0 "I captured Shapibel, the stronghold of Gambulu. I entered that city and slaughtered its inhabitants like lambs. I bound hand and foot Dunanu and Sam'gunu, who had made the exercising of sovereignty difficult for me, in shackles, fetters of iron, bonds of iron. The rest of the sons of Bel-iqisha, his family, the seed of his father's house, all there were, Nabu-na'id, Bel-etir, sons of Nabu-shum-eresh, the proconsul, and the bones of the father who begot them, together with Urbi and Tebe, peoples of Gambulu, cattle, sheep, asses, horses, mules, I carried off from Gambulu to Assyria. I devastated Shapibel, his stronghold. I destroyed it and laid waste to it by flooding it."
 assyrian_path_13:0 "Ashurnasirpal's Revenge"
 assyrian_path_13_desc:0 "I flayed as many nobles as had rebelled against me and draped their skins over the pile of corpses; some I spread out within the pile, some I erected on stakes upon the pile. I flayed many right through my land and draped their skins over the walls."

 assyrian_path_15_desc:0 "In strife and conflict I besieged and conquered the city. I felled 3,000 of their fighting men with the sword. I captured many troops alive. I cut off of some their arms and hands; I cut off others' noses, ears and extremities. I gouged out the eyes of many troops. I made one pile of the living and one of heads. I hung their heads on trees around the city."

 armenian_path_2:0 "Scythed Chariots"
 armenian_path_2_desc:0 "When Nicomedes and the generals of Mithridates came in sight of each other in a wide plain bordered by the river Amnias, they drew up their forces for battle. Nicomedes had his entire army in hand; Neoptolemus and Archelaus had only their light infantry and the cavalry of Arcathias and a few chariots; for the phalanx had not yet come up. They sent forward a small force to seize a rocky hill in the plain lest they should be surrounded by the Bithynians, who were much more numerous. When Neoptolemus saw his men driven from the hill he was still more in fear of being surrounded. He advanced with haste to their assistance, at the same time calling on Arcathias for help. When Nicomedes perceived the movement, he sought to meet it by a similar one. Thereupon a severe and bloody struggle ensued. Nicomedes prevailed and put the Mithridateans to flight until Archelaus, advancing from the right flank, fell upon the pursuers, who were compelled to turn their attention to him. He yielded little by little in order that the forces of Neoptolemus might have a chance to rally. When he judged that they had done so sufficiently, he advanced again. At the same time the scythe-bearing chariots made a charge on the Bithynians, cutting some of them in two, and tearing others to pieces. The army of Nicomedes was terrified at seeing men cut in halves and still breathing, or mangled in fragments and their parts hanging on the scythes. Overcome rather by the hideousness of the spectacle than by loss of the fight, fear took possession of their ranks. While they were thus thrown into confusion, Archelaus attacked them in front, and Neoptolemus and Arcathias, who had turned about, assailed them in the rear. They fought a long time facing both ways. After the greater part of his men had fallen, Nicomedes fled with the remainder into Paphlagonia, although the Mithridatean phalanx had not come into the engagement at all. His camp was captured, together with a large sum of money and many prisoners. All these Mithridates treated kindly and sent to their homes with supplies for the journey, thus gaining a reputation for clemency among his enemies."

A hundred Sarmatian horse of his advance-guard came upon 800 of the Nicomedean cavalry and took some of them prisoners. Mithridates dismissed these also to their homes and furnished them supplies. Neoptolemus, and Nemanes the Armenian, overtook Manius on his retreat at the castle of Protophachium about the seventh hour, while Nicomedes was moving away to join Cassius, and compelled him to fight. He had 4,000 horse and ten times that number of foot. They killed 10,000 of his men and took 300 prisoners. When they were brought to Mithridates he released them in like manner, thus winning the good opinion of his enemies. The camp of Manius was also captured. He fled to the river Sangarius, crossed it by night, and escaped to Pergamon. Cassius and Nicomedes and all the Roman ambassadors who were with the army decamped to a place called the Lion's Head, a very powerful stronghold in Phrygia, where they began to drill their newly collected mob of artisans, rustics, and other raw recruits, and made new levies among the Phrygians. Finding them worthless, they abandoned the idea of fighting with such unwarlike men, dismissed them and retreated; Cassius with his own army to Apamea, Nicomedes to Pergamon, and Manius toward Rhodes. When those who were guarding the mouth of the Euxine learned these facts they scattered also and delivered the straits and all the ships they had to Mithridates."

 persian_path_1_desc:0 "The satrap served as viceroy to the king, though with considerable autonomy."
 persian_path_2:0 "Kardakes"
 persian_path_2_desc:0 "Formerly, the Persians relied on heavily armored mercenary infantry known as the Kardakes. Present during Alexander's invasion, they were recruited from Persian lands, but employed as cheap mercenaries."
 persian_path_3:0 "Camel Mobility"
 persian_path_3_desc:0 "Cavalry make for excellent interceptors, cutting off routes of retreat, and interfering with supply lines. By ordering our camel riders to harass but never definitively engage, we deny our foes the convenience of a numerical advantage."
 persian_path_4:0 "Sparabara"
 persian_path_4_desc:0 "Unlike the Assyrians, who deployed one row of shield-bearers covering one row of archers, the Persians had one row of shield-bearers, called sparabara, protecting nine rows of archers behind them."
 persian_path_5:0 "Persian Valour"
 persian_path_5_desc:0 "On the side of the Achaemenids, the greatest courage was manifested, among the foot-soldiers, by the Persians; among the horse, by the Sacae ... The Achaemenid army indeed advanced as far as the Asopus, and endeavoured to tempt the Greeks to cross; but neither side actually passed the stream. Still the cavalry of Mardonius harassed and annoyed the Greeks incessantly; for the Thebans, who were zealous in the cause of the Medes, pressed the war forward with all eagerness, and often led the charge till the lines met, when the Medes and Persians took their place, and displayed, many of them, uncommon valour ... The fight went most against the Greeks, where Mardonius, mounted upon a white horse, and surrounded by the bravest of all the Persians, the thousand picked men, fought in person. So long as Mardonius was alive, this body resisted all attacks, and, while they defended their own lives, struck down no small number of Spartans."
 persian_path_6:0 "Populating the Countryside"
 persian_path_6_desc:0 "The vast hosts of ancient Persian kings are mentioned in numerous sources. The act of levying local men of fighting age must have contributed significantly to the dazzling size of the warhosts raised."
 persian_path_7:0 "Warriors of Ahura Mazda"
 persian_path_7_desc:0 "The sheer quantity of our troops can overwhelm any pitiful resistance. If our rivals do not bend to our will, they will surely break. The source of all goodness and the reason we fight is the uncreated god Ahura Mazda, worthy of the highest worship."
 persian_path_8:0 "The Immortals"
 persian_path_8_desc:0 "A legendary unit of soldiers known as the Immortals, supposedly named due to the constant size of the unit at 10,000 strong, the Immortals utilised a diverse array of weaponry, and heavy armor, providing a backbone of heavy infantry around which the rest of the army was formed." 
 persian_path_9:0 "Royal Line"
 persian_path_9_desc:0 "The Achaemenid line ran, unbroken from Cyrus to the fall of the Empire at the hands of Alexander the Great. Despite the recent subjujation, the glory days of the Persian empire remains strong and within living memory."
 persian_path_10:0 "Titans of Battle"
 persian_path_10_desc:0 "The proximity to India, led to the adoption of elephants as an entire wing of the army. Riders would sit, mounted on a howdah, giving them a vantage point over the melee below."
 persian_path_11:0 "Phalanx Adoption"
 persian_path_11_desc:0 "Alexander's campaigns left behind thousands of Greek mercenaries willing to serve for their subsistence. Later, many of the surrounding tribes began to be assimilated, leading to plentiful and cheap mercenary contracts being available. Since the Greek phalanx proved invincible against us, let us adopt this formation and give greater attention to our pike infantry."
 persian_path_12:0 "Perfect Storm"
 persian_path_12_desc:0 "The Graeco-Bactrian Kingdom, which developed in the mid-3rd Century BC, was a cultural melting pot of styles, people, and most importantly, tactics. The fusion of these diverse ways of doing battle, made for a formidable fighting force."
 persian_path_13:0 "Akinaka"
 persian_path_13_desc:0 "Though originally a long dagger of Scythian origin, the akinaka spread across the Achaemenid Empire. The Romans believed it had been invented by the Medes."
 persian_path_14:0 "Legacy of Cyrus"
 persian_path_14_desc:0 "The huge hosts of the Achaemenid empire instilled the Hellenic civilisations to the west with the utmost fear. The vast territory controlled by his empire, and the willingness of his people to serve, guaranteed a high throughput of soldiers."

 iranian_path_1_desc:0 "Praised for their prowess in archery by Herodotus, Achaemenid soldiers made use of the ubiquitous composite bow. In the famous Battle of Thermopylae, the sheer quantity of archers used by the native Persian troops were said to be able to blot out the very sun itself."
 iranian_path_2:0 "Sagartian Lasso"
 iranian_path_2_desc:0 "An ancient eastern Iranian nomadic tribe, the Sagartians provided 8,000 horsemen for King Xerxes' massive army during the Persian king's invasion of Greece in 480 BC. Their main weapon was the lasso, which they used to immobilise their victim before killing him."
 iranian_path_3:0 "Foot Sloggers"
 iranian_path_3_desc:0 "While the majority of steppe warfare was mounted, Scythian infantry are reported in numerous engagements in mid-Antiquity. The Battle of Thatis saw the use of a large Siracian contingent of infantry, warring against the early Bosporan Kingdom."
 iranian_path_4:0 "Bactrian Riders"
 iranian_path_4_desc:0 "Both the Achaemenids and the Macedonians used Bactrian horsemen in their forces, due to their skill and availability. Like the western Scythians, their culture was heavily influenced by an equine nomadic lifestyle."

 iranian_path_10:0 "Bactria"
 iranian_path_10_desc:0 "Bactria was a lush, fertile plain, surrounded by mountains, steppe and desert, in all directions. The adaptability required to survive here, leads to our armies being better prepared than most."
 iranian_path_11:0 "Kontos"
 iranian_path_11_desc:0 "The kontos ('oar' or 'barge pole') was the Greek name for a long wooden cavalry lance used by Achaemenid cavalry, most notably cataphracts. Measuring four metres long, it was a weapon of great power, described by Plutarch as being 'heavy with steel' and capable of impaling two men at once."
 iranian_path_12:0 "The Parthian Shot"
 iranian_path_12_desc:0 "The signature tactic of horse archers was the Parthian Shot. Requiring utter mastery over their steeds, the riders would retreat from their foe, and by twisting their bodies in the saddle, would fire back at their target."
 iranian_path_13:0 "Kleruchoi"
 iranian_path_13_desc:0 "The Macedonians created scores of settlements in Bactria during Alexander's conquests, many of which prospered. The Kleruchoi, as they were known, provided a loyal manpower base for generations."
 iranian_path_14:0 "Graeco-Bactrian Fortresses"
 iranian_path_14_desc:0 "The Greek influences on Bactria took hold unusually swiftly. Architecture and fortifications sprang up in these styles, often regarded as superior to their less hellenised neighbors."
 iranian_path_15:0 "Cataphracts"
 iranian_path_15_desc:0 "Many cultures with a history of equine mastery developed usage of heavy cavalry, or cataphracts, as a means of countering small arms. With both horse and rider clad in heavy scale or mail, nothing short of total rout would break the charge of a unit of cataphracts."

 bactrian_path_13_desc:0 "News had come in that a large number of the natives had taken refuge on the Rock of Sogdia, among them the wife and daughters of Oxyartes the Bactrian, who had himself refused to submit to Alexander and had chosen this refuge for his family in the belief that it was impregnable. To the Rock, therefore, Alexander advanced. He found that it rose sheer on every side against attack. The natives had provisioned it for a long siege, and deep snow on its summit caused the double disadvantage of making the ascent more awkward for the Macedonians and of ensuring the defenders an unlimited supply of water. None the less, Alexander determined on assault. The reason for his determination was the natives' offensive bragging, which made him angry. He had called on them to discuss terms, and offered to allow them to return to their homes on condition of surrendering the stronghold; but their answer to the offer was a shout of laughter. Then they told Alexander to bring soldiers with wings to capture the Rock for him, as no other sort of person could cause them the least anxiety. As a result, Alexander proclaimed that he would give twelve talents to the first man up, and eleven to the second, and ten to the third, and so on to the twelfth, who would receive 300 gold darics. Around 300 men who in previous sieges had had experience in rock-climbing now assembled and set off under cover of darkness to the steepest part of the rock-face, which they knew was least likely to be guarded; then, driving their pegs either into bare ground or into such patches of snow as seemed most likely to hold under the strain, they hauled themselves up, wherever each could find a way. About thirty lost their lives during the ascent, but the rest reached the top as dawn was breaking, and the summit of the Rock was theirs. Alexander sent a crier to shout the news to the enemy's advanced posts that they might now surrender, as men with wings had been found and were already in possession of the summit. The unexpectedness of the sight was a severe shock to the natives, who were so alarmed by the handful of Macedonian troops they could actually see, that, imagining a larger force, and fully armed at that, must be in possession, they surrendered."

Though ironmaking was already very well developed in the subcontinent, cotton armour was much lighter, cooler and cheaper than iron. As in the case of the linothorax, the layers of cotton were presumably joined together and hardened with glue made from boiling animal tendons and connective tissue. While fabric armour was not as tough as iron, it could come quite close."

When the elephant's discipline and mastery over itself broke, it was just as likely to trample its allies as the enemy army. A herd of elephants driven to panic could easily become a murderous stampede.

Owing to this, their country has never been conquered by any foreign king, for all other nations dread the overwhelming number and strength of these animals. Thus Alexander the Macedonian, after conquering all Asia, did not make war upon the Gangaridai, as he did on all others; for when he had arrived with all his troops at the river Ganges, he abandoned as hopeless an invasion of the Gangaridai when he learned that they possessed four thousand elephants well trained and equipped for war."
 pracyan_path_9:0 "Defending the Ganges"
 pracyan_path_9_desc:0 "But this last combat with Porus took off the edge of the Macedonians' courage, and stayed their further progress into India. For having found it hard enough to defeat an enemy who brought but twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse into the field, they thought they had reason to oppose Alexander's design of leading them on to pass the Ganges, too, which they were told was thirty-two furlongs broad and a fathom deep, and the banks on the further side covered with multitudes of enemies."

 egyptian_path_5_desc:0 "Our mounted warriors ride into battle on fierce and sturdy camels. Surprisingly resilient in battle, our camelry use their maneouverability as their main defense."
 egyptian_path_6:0 "For the Pharaoh"
 egyptian_path_6_desc:0 "Our Pharaoh is a god among men, our Nile brings us life, our borders are unforgiving to the enemy. We must do our best to hold these borders, protect the Nile and defend the Pharaoh. There are no cowards in the Kemetic army."
 egyptian_path_7:0 "Sarrisae"
 egyptian_path_7_desc:0 "Another Hellenic invention, the Sarisa, allows our troops to engage the enemy at a great distance thanks to it's 21dt length. An impregnable wall of spears will face our foes, they will clash against us, they will fall, they will not rise"
 egyptian_path_8:0 "Speed and Aggression"
 egyptian_path_8_desc:0 "The Desert is the perfect place to have a corps of lightly armed cavalry to harass the enemy while they march and flank them in battle. Maintaining a force of lightly armoured but nimble cavalry is a must to desert warfare."
 egyptian_path_9:0 "The Spear of the Kingdom"
 egyptian_path_9_desc:0 "Egyptian ancestors fought with bronze spears, clad in all but the most basic protection. With the advent of iron-working, weapons and armor have been improved tenfold, and our soldiers further bolstered."
 egyptian_path_10:0 "Greek Warfare"
 egyptian_path_10_desc:0 "As with the other successor states, the phalanx made up the core of the Ptolemiac army. Comprised of varying unit-types, the core principle was the same as inherited from the Macedonian reformation of the style, many decades previously."
 egyptian_path_11:0 "Professional Riders"
 egyptian_path_11_desc:0 "Having the natives expertise with camels and light cavalry is all well and good but we must maintain a corps of heavily armed and well trained shock cavalry to back them up. These types of forces helped Alexander conquer the world, they will surly help us at least defend our borders."
 egyptian_path_12:0 "Learning From the Best"
 egyptian_path_12_desc:0 "Having seen Roman troops in action, the Seleukid and Ptolemaic dynasties attempted to mimic aspects of Roman military philosophy in their own forces. Whilst limited in success, the greater attention to mobility and flexibility must have paid dividends in many engagements."
 egyptian_path_13:0 "Machimoni Epilektoi"
 egyptian_path_13_desc:0 "Native Egyptian soldiers played little part in the Ptolemaic army, until the formation of the 'Chosen Machimoi', after manpower concerns were raised. Despite the unpopularity of this move by the Greek soldiery, the Machimoi held a valued place in the Ptolemaic army, and were renowned for their ferocity."
 egyptian_path_14:0 "Ships of the Desert"
 egyptian_path_14_desc:0 "Our knowledge of the desert, and of the vagaries of the ever-shifting geography it creates, melds perfectly with our long tradition of swift, mounted warfare."
 egyptian_path_15:0 "Rank Upon Rank"
 egyptian_path_15_desc:0 "The great hordes of Egypt, as if assembled by the Pharaohs of old, strike fear into the hearts of those who dare oppose us!"
