The planned assassination of [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName] is beginning to take shape - however, [SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetPraenomen] has requested that we send aid, that [SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetSheHe] might be better able to perform [SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetHerHis] covert duties."
 assassinate.1.a:0 "Anything. [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] must die."

 assassinate.2.desc:0 "Due to the convenient death of [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName], in circumstances not of our making, our attempted assassination is no longer required.\n\nWe have instructed our agents to return what resources they have not already made use of, that we might recover some of our costs."

 assassinate.4.t:0 "Agent Exposed!"
 assassinate.4.desc:0 "Seemingly, we were unwise to put our trust in foreign friends.

 assassinate.5.t:0 "Murder is a Tricky Business"
 assassinate.5.desc:0 "Once more, our agents have received communication from our contact in [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetEmployer.GetName]. It would appear that [SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetSheHe] is having some trouble planning [SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetHerHis] escape, once [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] has been assassinated. [SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetSheHe|U] demands that we send a scapegoat, in order that someone is able to take the fall without drawing suspicion.\n\nSuch a scapegoat would be unlikely to return from this task..."

 assassinate.6.desc:0 "Clearly beset by future concerns, our agent in [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetEmployer.GetName] has contacted us once more, requesting a promise of asylum once the deed is done.\n\nOur advisors are divided as to whether this would be a wise move."
