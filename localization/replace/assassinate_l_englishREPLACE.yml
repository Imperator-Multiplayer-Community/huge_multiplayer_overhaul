The planned assassination of [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetName] is beginning to take shape - however, [SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetPraenomen] has requested that we send aid, that [SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetSheHe] might be better able to perform [SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetHerHis] covert duties."
 assassinate.1.a:0 "Anything. [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetPraenomen] must die."

 assassinate.4.desc:0 "Seemingly, we were unwise to put our trust in foreign friends.

 assassinate.5.desc:0 "Once more, our agents have received communication from our contact in [SCOPE.sChar('target').GetEmployer.GetName].

[SCOPE.sChar('foreign_agent').GetSheHe|U] demands that we send a scapegoat, in order that someone is able to take the fall without drawing suspicion.\n\nSuch a scapegoat would be unlikely to return from this task..."
